### 🧭 About Me  
I’m **Yogesh Kumar Mallik (born 2006)** — a student and self-taught developer who believes that ideas become real only through discipline, collaboration, and code.  

I founded **QiForge**, not as a team, but as an **ideology** — a forge where ideas are shaped into technology, and people into creators.  
As its Founder & Leader, I build systems, guide developers, and create opportunities for others to discover their potential through real work — not theory.  

> **QiForge is my reflection.**  
> It’s where I lead, teach, and build alongside those who dare to create.

### 🔥 QiForge at a Glance  
**QiForge** is a student-driven organization that transforms curiosity into creation.  
It’s not a classroom. It’s a **foundry** — where code, design, and innovation collide.  

🧩 **Divisions I Lead & Manage:**  
- **Code Lead** – Core development team responsible for building QiForge’s main systems.  
- **Code Falcon** – Project division focused on real-world applications (currently developing *Hostel & Mess Management System*).  
- **Community Mentorship** – Informal sessions to guide students entering tech.  

💠 **Core Principle:**  
> “We build not for grades, not for fame — but to become something worth following.”
